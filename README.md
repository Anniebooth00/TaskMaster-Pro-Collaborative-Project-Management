# TaskMaster-Pro-Collaborative-Project-Management
This project involves creating a task board application that allows a team to manage project tasks by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It also utilizes the Day.js library for date manipulation, ensuring tasks are color-coded based on their deadlines.
